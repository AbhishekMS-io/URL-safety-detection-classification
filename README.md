A phishing URL is a malicious link used in phishing attacks to deceive users into visiting a fake website. This website is designed to mimic a legitimate site, such as a bank or social media platform, with the intent of tricking users into providing sensitive information like login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal data. Phishing URLs often appear in emails, text messages, or social media posts and are crafted to look trustworthy, using techniques like typosquatting, link masking, or HTTPS spoofing to create a false sense of security
